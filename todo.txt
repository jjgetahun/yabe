<> The functionality of the system can be naturally divided into
 (0) account handling (end-users (buyers & sellers), customer representatives, admin staff)
 (I) auction functionality
 (II) browsing and advanced search functionality
 (III) customer representatives & admin functions
 (IV) history of auctions and auction similarity

As a group of 3, you could divide the final programming work into (0)(II), 
(I) and  (III), (IV).
